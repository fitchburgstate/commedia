					The Theater concentration provides students the opportunity each semester to perform full-scale theatrical productions, produced and directed by our Theater faculty and students. Our Theater professors are members of professional unions and act and direct in Boston and New York City. Productions range from the Greeks to the contemporary repertoire. By the time our students graduate, after completing a required 12-credit, professional internship, they have acquired a wide range of skills and theater genre that will support their goal of graduate study or direct entry into the profession.

						The play tells the story of Jason Brooks, who must write an obituary to avoid being haunted by his mother after she escapes Charon the Ferryman in Hades. In so doing, he confronts the fact that he knows almost nothing about her that is 100 percent true. The play uses a non-linear structure to whipsaw between time periods as characters try to figure out what’s real and what’s imaginary.

						“The Diviners” is about a disturbed young man and his friendship with a disenchanted preacher in the fictional town of Zion, Ind., in the early 1930s. Variety hailed the play as “a splendid drama by a playwright … with poetic as well as human feeling,” as well as “both touching and entertaining.” New York Magazine said the drama “renders the humor and horror of the hinterlands with staggering accuracy.”
