				<h2>National Student Advertising Competition</h2>
				<p>
					Each year students from the Communications Media Department participate in The National Student Advertising Competition (NSAC). Colleges all over the country compete to create the best marketing plan for a sponsoring organization. Fitchburg State has competed in District 1, one of the most competitive districts in the country. In 2019 the sponsoring organization was Wienerschnitzel. The team at Fitchburg State created a broad range of marketing content such as ad slogans, designs, and commercials. Fitchburg State placed third. This competition gives students professional content for their portfolios and practical experience in marketing and advertising.
