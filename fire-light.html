				Fire and Light explores the work of internationally renowned artist, Otto Piene (b. Germany, 1928–2014), focusing on his major threads of production since the mid-1980s when he moved to Groton, MA. Piene’s relentless exploration of light through the elements of fire and air led to groundbreaking achievements in art and technology, as he continued to push the boundaries of visual perception and sensory experience through new media. Fire and Light offers a rare opportunity for visitors to experience Piene’s immersive installations, paintings, and sculptures.
