excerpt: Film and Video Concentration
col: film-video
---
The Film and Video concentration allows students to work in both film and digital media, as well as study both narrative fiction and documentary filmmaking. Beginning in their first year, students are given hands-on instruction in a deeply immersive environment that stresses both the technical and aesthetic aspects of media creation. All students have access to a wide range of industry standard cameras, lights, audio gear and post-production facilities. Within the concentration, students work both collaboratively and individually on a multitude of projects. In their final semester, all eligible students gain professional industry experience in a full-time internship either locally, in Los Angeles, New York or elsewhere.
