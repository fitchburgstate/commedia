				<h2><i>The Diviners</i></h2>
				<p>
					“The Diviners” is about a disturbed young man and his friendship with a disenchanted preacher in the fictional town of Zion, Ind., in the early 1930s. Variety hailed the play as “a splendid drama by a playwright … with poetic as well as human feeling,” as well as “both touching and entertaining.” New York Magazine said the drama “renders the humor and horror of the hinterlands with staggering accuracy.”
