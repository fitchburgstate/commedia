					This concentration gives students the opportunity to focus their career goals in the following areas: public relations, advertising, marketing communications, multi-media and document design and professional leadership. Each course in the concentration combines conceptual study, creative process and practical application to prepare our graduates for the expectations of professional communication environments.
