The Theater concentration provides students the opportunity each semester to perform full-scale theatrical productions, produced and directed by our Theater faculty and students. Our Theater professors are members of professional unions and act and direct in Boston and New York City. Productions range from the Greeks to the contemporary repertoire. By the time our students graduate, after completing a required 12-credit, professional internship, they have acquired a wide range of skills and theater genre that will support their goal of graduate study or direct entry into the profession.
