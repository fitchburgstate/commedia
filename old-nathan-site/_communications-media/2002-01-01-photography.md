Students in this concentration have access to one of the finest photographic facilities in New England. Our students work with professional equipment as early as their first year. Students learn through hands-on experience with equipment ranging from the traditional darkroom to the latest digital technologies, including professional digital cameras, imaging software and archival inkjet printers.
