A unique feature of our curriculum is the strong emphasis on taking what is learned in the classroom and applying it in the field. Our students acquire internships at incredible companies across the country, and often get hired by these same companies upon graduation because of the skills and work ethic they brought to the table as an intern.

Our faculty is dedicated to challenge our students to think critically and to help them create works that not only push their boundaries, but push the boundaries of those who view their work.
